# CSM Guide

This guide focuses solely on the technical setup of Ethereum validators using Lido's Community Staking Module (CSM).

We recommend that you first understand the **concepts and requirements** of participating in the [Lido CSM Operator Portal](https://operatorportal.lido.fi/modules/community-staking-module) before you proceed. Other resources are linked below.
