# Automated Graceful Shutdown & Remote Wake

For operators who spend lots of time away from home with frequent power trips, you may want to set up the following:

1. Add an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) to your setup. This is basically a back-up battery for your node  
2. Configure your node to gracefully shut down automatically when main-line power is cut and turn itself back on when main-line power is restored  
3. Manually turn your node back on remotely as a failsafe
