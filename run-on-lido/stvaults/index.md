## Building guides
The stVaults platform enables the creation of staking products tailored to different target audiences with diverse needs. These two comprehensive guides provide detailed instructions on how to create any product powered by stVaults.

| Staking Product | Value Proposition | Target Audience |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| [Basic stVault with optional liquidity](./building-guides/basic-stvault.md) | A competitive alternative to native staking: users stake with the same Node Operator while gaining optional liquidity through stETH. | Institutional stakers, large individual stakers (32+ ETH), funds, treasuries, builders, integrators, liquidity providers. |
| **(Coming soon)** Pooled staking product with white-labeled UI and yield-boosting strategy | A DeFi-wrapped stVault with pooling, liquidity, automated yield-boosting strategy, and white-labeled staking UI – all in one customizable no-code/low-code solution. | Retail stakers (< 32 ETH), APR-maximizers, institutional stakers seeking a simple staking UI. |
