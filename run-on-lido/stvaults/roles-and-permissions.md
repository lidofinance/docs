# Roles and permissions
:::warning
This document covers roles and permissions intended for stVaults on mainnet. The implementation on deployed testnet contracts may vary.
:::
## Vault contract role

**Node Operator** provides validation service for the vault: handles depositing ETH from the vault balance to validators and exiting validators if necessary. Address of the Node Operator can’t be changed after the vault is created.

### Node Operator's non-delegable permissions
| Operation |
| -------- |
| Deposit ETH from Staking Vault to validators using Predeposit Guarantee contract. |

## Dashboard contract roles and permissions

1. **Vault Owner** [Dashboard contract role DEFAULT_ADMIN (VAULT_OWNER)] is one of the two admin roles for the stVault, allows to manage permissions and change key vault parameters from the Vault Owner (Staker) perspective. Multiple addresses supported.

2. **Node Operator Manager** [Dashboard contract role NODE_OPERATOR_MANAGER] is another of the two admin roles for the stVault, allows to manage permissions and change key vault parameters from the Node Operator perspective. Multiple addresses supported.

**Vault Owner** and **Node Operator Manager** addresses have permissions for all actions within their respective scopes in stVaults. They can also delegate specific permissions (sub-roles) to other addresses.

|| Propose and confirm changing NO fee by Multi-roles confirmation. |

| -------- | -------- |
| NODE_OPERATOR_UNGUARANTEED_DEPOSIT_ROLE | Withdraw ether from vault and deposits directly to provided validators bypassing the default PDG process |
| NODE_OPERATOR_PROVE_UNKNOWN_VALIDATOR_ROLE | Prove unknown validators through PDG |
