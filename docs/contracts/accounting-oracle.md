:::info
It's advised to read [What is Lido Oracle mechanism](/guides/oracle-operator-manual#intro) before
:::

## What is AccountingOracle

AccountingOracle is a contract which collects information submitted by the off-chain oracles about state of the Lido-participating validators and their balances, the
amount of funds accumulated on the protocol vaults (i.e., [withdrawal](/contracts/withdrawal-vault) and [execution layer rewards](/contracts/lido-execution-layer-rewards-vault) vaults), the number [exited and stuck](/contracts/staking-router#exited-and-stuck-validators) validators, the number of [withdrawal requests](/contracts/withdrawal-queue-erc721#request) the protocol is able to process and distributes node-operator rewards.

## Report cycle

The oracle work is delineated by equal time periods called frames. In normal operation, oracles finalize a report in each frame (the frame duration is 225 Ethereum Consensus Layer epochs, each frame starts at ~12:00 noon UTC). Each frame has a reference slot and processing deadline. Report data is gathered by looking at the world state (both Ethereum Execution and Consensus Layers) at the moment of the frame's reference slot (including any state changes made in that slot), and must be processed before the frame's processing deadline.

Reference slot for each frame is set to the last slot of the epoch preceding the frame's first epoch. The processing deadline is set to the last slot of the last epoch of the frame.

It's worth noting that frame length [can be changed](/contracts/hash-consensus#setframeconfig). And if oracle report is delayed it does not extend the report period, unless it's missed. In this case, the next report will have the report period increased.

The frame includes these stages:

- **Waiting:** oracle starts as a [daemon](/guides/oracle-operator-manual#the-oracle-daemon) and wakes up every 12 seconds (by default) in order to find the last finalized slot, trying to collate with it with the expected reference slot;
- **Data collection:** oracles monitor the state of both the execution and consensus layers and collect the data for the successfully arrived finalized reference slot;
- **Hash consensus:** oracles analyze the data, compile the report and submit its hash to the [`HashConsensus`](/contracts/hash-consensus) smart contract;
- **Core update report:** once the [quorum](/contracts/hash-consensus#getquorum) of hashes is reached, meaning more than half of the oracles submitted the same hash (i.e., 5 of 9 oracle committee members at the moment of writing), one of the oracles chosen in turn submits the actual report to the `AccountingOracle` contract, which triggers the core protocol state update, including the token rebase, distribution of node operator rewards, finalization of withdrawal requests, and the protocol mode decision: whether to go in the bunker mode, and
- **Extra data report:** an additional report carrying additional information that is not vital for the core update is submitted to the AccountingOracle, can be submitted in chunks (e.g, node operator key states and reward distribution data).

:::note
As it was said, daily oracle reports shouldn't be taken for granted.
Oracle daemons could stop pushing their reports for extended periods of time in case of no
[finality](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/#finality) on the Ethereum Consensus Layer.
This would ultimately result in no oracle reports and no stETH rebases for this whole period.
:::

## Report processing

The [submission](/contracts/accounting-oracle#submitreportdata) of the main report to `AccountingOracle` triggers the next processes in order, although within a single tx:

1. Update exited validators counts for each StakingModule in StakingRouter;
2. Update bunker mode status for WithdrawalQueue;
3. Handle function on the Lido contract which performs the main protocol state change.
4. Store information about ExtraData

The diagram shows the interaction with contracts.

## Report data

The function `submitReportData()` accepts the following `ReportData` structure.

```solidity
struct ReportData {
    uint256 consensusVersion;
    uint256 refSlot;
    uint256 numValidators;
    uint256 clBalanceGwei;
    uint256[] stakingModuleIdsWithNewlyExitedValidators;
    uint256[] numExitedValidatorsByStakingModule;
    uint256 withdrawalVaultBalance;
    uint256 elRewardsVaultBalance;
    uint256 sharesRequestedToBurn;
    uint256[] withdrawalFinalizationBatches;
    uint256 simulatedShareRate;
    bool isBunkerMode;
    uint256 extraDataFormat;
    bytes32 extraDataHash;
    uint256 extraDataItemsCount;
}
```

**Oracle consensus info**

- `consensusVersion` — Version of the oracle consensus rules. A current version expected by the oracle can be obtained by calling `getConsensusVersion()`.
- `refSlot` — Reference slot for which the report was calculated. The state being reported must include all state changes resulting from the all blocks up to this reference slot (inclusive). The epoch containing the slot must be finalized prior to calculating the report.

**CL values**

- `numValidators` — The number of validators on the Ethereum Consensus Layer that were ever deposited via Lido as observed at the reference slot.
- `clBalanceGwei` — Cumulative balance nominated in gwei of all Lido validators on the Ethereum Consensus Layer as observed at the reference slot.
- `stakingModuleIdsWithNewlyExitedValidators` — Ids of staking modules that have more exited validators than the number stored in the respective staking module contract as observed at the reference slot.
- `numExitedValidatorsByStakingModule` — Number of ever exited validators for each of the staking modules from the `stakingModuleIdsWithNewlyExitedValidators` array as observed at the reference slot.

**EL values**

- `withdrawalVaultBalance` — Ether balance of the Lido [withdrawal vault](/contracts/withdrawal-vault) as observed at the reference slot.
- `elRewardsVaultBalance` — Ether balance of the Lido [execution layer rewards vault](/contracts/lido-execution-layer-rewards-vault) as observed at the reference slot.
- `sharesRequestedToBurn` — The shares amount requested to burn through [Burner](/contracts/burner) as observed at the reference slot. The value can be obtained in the following way:

```solidity
(coverSharesToBurn, nonCoverSharesToBurn) = IBurner(burner).getSharesRequestedToBurn()
sharesRequestedToBurn = coverSharesToBurn + nonCoverSharesToBurn
```

**Withdrawals finalization decision**

- `withdrawalFinalizationBatches` — The ascendingly-sorted array of withdrawal request IDs obtained by the oracle daemon on report gathering via calling [`WithdrawalQueue.calculateFinalizationBatches`](/contracts/withdrawal-queue-erc721#calculatefinalizationbatches). An empty array means that no withdrawal requests to be finalized.
- `simulatedShareRate` — The share rate (i.e., [total pooled ether](/contracts/lido#gettotalpooledether) divided by [total shares](/contracts/lido#gettotalshares)) with the 10^27 precision (i.e., multiplied by 10^27) that would be effective as the result of applying this oracle report at the reference slot, with `withdrawalFinalizationBatches` set to empty array and `simulatedShareRate` set to 0. To estimate `simulatedShareRate` one should perform a view call [Lido.handleOracleReport](/contracts/lido#handleoraclereport) directly via [`eth_call`](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_call) JSON-RPC API and calculate as follows:

```solidity
_simulatedShareRate = (postTotalPooledEther * 10**27) / postTotalShares
```

where `postTotalPooledEther` and `postTotalShares` were retrieved as return values from the performed view call

- `isBunkerMode` — Whether, based on the state observed at the reference slot, the protocol must be in the bunker mode or the turbo (regular) mode.

:::note

##### Extra data

Extra data — the oracle information that allows asynchronous processing, potentially in
    chunks, after the main data is processed. The oracle doesn't enforce that extra data
    attached to the same data report is processed in full before the processing deadline expires
    or a new data report starts being processed, but enforces that no processing of extra
    data for a report is possible after its processing deadline passes or a new data report
    arrives.

Depending on the size of the extra data, the processing might need to be split into
multiple transactions. Each transaction contains a chunk of report data (an array of items)
and the hash of the next transaction. The last transaction will contain ZERO_HASH
as the next transaction hash.

      32 bytes      array of items
    | nextHash |         ...    

Extra data is an array of items, each item being encoded as follows:

       3 bytes    2 bytes      X bytes
    | itemIndex | itemType | itemPayload |

- `itemIndex` is a 0-based index into the extra data array;
- `itemType` is the type of extra data item;
- `itemPayload` is the item's data which interpretation depends on the item's type.

Items must be sorted ascendingly by the `(itemType, ...itemSortingKey)` compound key
where `itemSortingKey` calculation depends on the item's type (see below).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**`itemType=0`** (`EXTRA_DATA_TYPE_STUCK_VALIDATORS`): stuck validators by node operators.

The `itemPayload` field has the following format:

    | 3 bytes  |   8 bytes    |  nodeOpsCount * 8 bytes  |  nodeOpsCount * 16 bytes  |
    | moduleId | nodeOpsCount |      nodeOperatorIds     |   stuckValidatorsCounts   |

`moduleId` is the staking module for which exited keys counts are being reported.

`nodeOperatorIds` contains an array of ids of node operators that have total stuck
    validators counts changed compared to the staking module smart contract storage as
    observed at the reference slot. Each id is a 8-byte uint, ids are packed tightly.

`nodeOpsCount` contains the number of node operator ids contained in the nodeOperatorIds
    array. Thus,

    nodeOpsCount = byteLength(nodeOperatorIds) / 8

`stuckValidatorsCounts` contains an array of stuck validators total counts, as observed at
    the reference slot, for the node operators from the nodeOperatorIds array, in the same
    order. Each count is a 16-byte uint, counts are packed tightly. Thus,

    byteLength(stuckValidatorsCounts) = nodeOpsCount * 16

`nodeOpsCount` must not be greater than `maxItemsPerExtraDataTransaction` specified
    in the [`OracleReportSanityChecker`](./oracle-report-sanity-checker) contract. If a staking module has more node operators
    with total stuck validators counts changed compared to the staking module smart contract
    storage (as observed at the reference slot), reporting for that module should be split
    into multiple items.

Item sorting key is a compound key consisting of the module id and the first reported
    node operator's id:

    itemSortingKey = (moduleId, nodeOperatorIds[0:8])

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**`itemType=1`** (`EXTRA_DATA_TYPE_EXITED_VALIDATORS`): exited validators by node operators.

The payload format is exactly the same as for `itemType=EXTRA_DATA_TYPE_STUCK_VALIDATORS`,
    except that, instead of stuck validators counts, exited validators counts are reported.
    The `itemSortingKey` is calculated identically.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The oracle daemon must report exited/stuck validators counts ONLY for those
    `(moduleId, nodeOperatorId)` pairs that contain outdated counts in the staking
    module smart contract as observed at the reference slot.

Extra data array can be passed in different formats, see below.

:::

- `extraDataFormat` -  Format of the extra data. Currently, only the `EXTRA_DATA_FORMAT_EMPTY=0` and `EXTRA_DATA_FORMAT_LIST=1` formats are supported. See the constant defining a specific data format for more info.
- `extraDataHash` - Hash of the extra data. See the constant defining a specific extra data format for the info on how to calculate the hash. Must be set to a zero hash if the oracle report contains no extra data.
- `extraDataItemsCount` - Number of the extra data items. Must be set to zero if the oracle report contains no extra data.

:::

```solidity
uint256 public immutable GENESIS_TIME
```

### EXTRA_DATA_TYPE_STUCK_VALIDATORS()

This type carries the details of [stuck](/contracts/staking-router#exited-and-stuck-validators) validator(s).

```solidity
uint256 public constant EXTRA_DATA_TYPE_STUCK_VALIDATORS = 1
```

### EXTRA_DATA_TYPE_EXITED_VALIDATORS()

### EXTRA_DATA_FORMAT_EMPTY()

The extra data format used to signify that the oracle report contains no [extra data](/contracts/accounting-oracle#extra-data).

Sends as a part of the Oracle's [Phase 3](/guides/oracle-operator-manual#phase-3-submitting-a-report-extra-data).

This format uses when there are no new [stuck](/contracts/staking-router#exited-and-stuck-validators) or [exited](/contracts/staking-router#exited-and-stuck-validators) validators on report period.

```solidity

 fits into a single transaction.

Extra data is passed within a single transaction as a bytearray containing all data items
packed tightly.

Hash is a `keccak256` hash calculated over the bytearray items. The Solidity equivalent of
the hash calculation code would be `keccak256(array)`, where `array` has the `bytes` type.

### submitConsensusReport()

Called by [AccountingOracle HashConsensus](/contracts/hash-consensus) contract to push a consensus report for processing.

:::note
Note that submitting the report doesn't require the processor to start processing it right
 away, this can happen later (see [`getLastProcessingRefSlot`](#getlastprocessingrefslot)). Until processing is started,
 HashConsensus is free to reach consensus on another report for the same reporting frame an
 submit it using this same function, or to lose the consensus on the submitted report,
 notifying the processor via `discardConsensusReport`.
:::

```solidity
function submitConsensusReport(bytes32 reportHash, uint256 refSlot, uint256 deadline)
```

#### Parameters

| Name              | Type          | Description                                                  |

### discardConsensusReport()

Called by HashConsensus contract to notify that the report for the given ref. slot
 is not a consensus report anymore and should be discarded. This can happen when a member
 changes their report, is removed from the set, or when the quorum value gets increased.

1. there previously was a consensus report; AND
2. processing of the consensus report hasn't started yet; AND
3. report processing deadline is not expired yet; AND
4. there's no consensus report now (otherwise, [submitConsensusReport](#submitconsensusreport) is called instead).

Can be called even when there's no submitted non-discarded consensus report for the current
reference slot, i.e. can be called multiple times in succession.
