# LidoOracle

- [Source code](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-dao/blob/master/contracts/0.4.24/oracle/LidoOracle.sol)
- [Deployed contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x442af784A788A5bd6F42A01Ebe9F287a871243fb)

LidoOracle is a contract where oracles send addresses' balances controlled by the DAO on the ETH
2.0 side. The balances can go up because of reward accumulation and can go down due to slashing and
staking penalties. Oracles are assigned by the DAO.

Oracle daemons push their reports every frame (225 epochs currently, equal to one day) and when the
number of the same reports reaches the ['quorum'](#getquorum) value, the report is pushed to the
[Lido contract][6].

The following mechanisms are also worth mentioning.


## Store the collected reports as an array

The report variant is a report with a counter - how many times this report was pushed by
oracles. This strongly simplified logic of `_getQuorumReport`, because in the majority of cases, we
only have 1 variant of the report so we just make sure that its counter exceeded the quorum value.

:::note
The important note here is that when we remove an oracle (with `removeOracleMember`), we
also need to remove her report from the currently accepted reports. As of now, we do not keep a
mapping between members and their reports, we just clean all existing reports and wait for the
remaining oracles to push the same epoch again.
:::


## Add calculation of staker rewards [APR][1]

To calculate the percentage of rewards for stakers, we store and provide the following data:

* `preTotalPooledEther` - total pooled ether mount, queried right before every report push to the
  [Lido contract][6],
* `postTotalPooledEther` - the same, but queried right after the push,
* `lastCompletedEpochId` - the last epoch that we pushed the report to the Lido,
* `timeElapsed` - the time in seconds between the current epoch of push and the
  `lastCompletedEpochId`. Usually, it should be a frame long: 32 * 12 * 225 = 86400, but maybe
  multiples more in case that the previous frame didn't reach the quorum.

:::note
It is important to note here, that we collect post/pre pair (not current/last), to avoid
the influence of new staking during the epoch.
:::

To calculate the APR, use the following formula:

    APR = (postTotalPooledEther - preTotalPooledEther) * secondsInYear / (preTotalPooledEther * timeElapsed)


## Sanity checks the oracles reports by configurable values

In order to limit the misbehaving oracles impact, we want to limit oracles report change by 10% APR
increase in stake and 5% decrease in stake. Both values are configurable by the governance in case
of extremely unusual circumstances.

:::note
Note that the change is evaluated after the quorum of oracles reports is reached, and not
on the individual report.
:::

And the logic of reporting to the [Lido contract][6] got a call to `_reportSanityChecks` that does
the following. It compares the `preTotalPooledEther` and `postTotalPooledEther` (see above) and

* if there is a profit or same, calculates the [APR][1], compares it with the upper bound. If was
  above, reverts the transaction with `ALLOWED_BEACON_BALANCE_INCREASE` code.
* if there is a loss, calculates relative decrease and compares it with the lower bound. If was
  below, reverts the transaction with `ALLOWED_BEACON_BALANCE_DECREASE` code.


## Receiver function to be invoked on report pushes

To provide the external contract with updates on report pushes (every time the quorum is reached
among oracle daemons data), we provide the following setter and getter functions. It might be
needed to implement some updates to the external contracts that should happen at the same tx the
[rebase](/docs/contracts/lido#rebasing) happens (e.g. adjusting uniswap v2 pools to reflect the
rebase).

And when the callback is set, the following function will be invoked on every report push.

    interface IBeaconReportReceiver {
        function processLidoOracleReport(uint256 _postTotalPooledEther,
                                         uint256 _preTotalPooledEther,
                                         uint256 _timeElapsed) external;
    }

The arguments provided are the same as described in section [above][3].
