## What is ValidatorsExitBusOracle

A contract that implements an on-chain "source of truth" message bus between the protocol's off-chain oracle and off-chain observers,
with the main goal of delivering validator exit requests to the Lido-participating node operators.

A report calculation consists of 4 key steps:

1. Calculate withdrawals amount to cover with ether.
2. Calculate ether rewards prediction per epoch.
3. Calculate withdrawal epoch for next validator eligible for exit to cover withdrawal requests if needed
4. Prepare validators exit order queue
5. Go through the queue until the exited validators’ balances cover all withdrawal requests (considering the predicated final exited balance of each validator).

:::note
Placed exit requests via `ValidatorsExitBusOracle` should be processed timely according to the ratified Lido on Ethereum Validator Exits SNOP 2.0 ([IPFS](https://lido.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZTMfmJZsYHz61f2FjhYdh5VNu6ifjYQJzYUGkysHs8Uu), [GitHub](https://github.com/lidofinance/documents-and-policies/blob/0ed664255f48ef224b96fb0325f4d27bd3c03773/Lido%20on%20Ethereum%20Standard%20Node%20Operator%20Protocol%20-%20Validator%20Exits.md), [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@lido/Bk9oDtV7ye)).

Access to lever methods is restricted using the functionality of the
[AccessControlEnumerable](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-dao/blob/master/contracts/0.8.9/utils/access/AccessControlEnumerable.sol)
contract and a bunch of [granular roles](#permissions).

## Report cycle

The oracle work is delineated by equal time periods called frames. In normal operation, oracles finalize a report in each frame (the frame duration is 75 Ethereum Consensus Layer epochs, each frame starts at ~04:00, ~12:00, ~20:00 UTC). Each frame has a reference slot and processing deadline. Report data is gathered by looking at the world state (both Ethereum Execution and Consensus Layers) at the moment of the frame's reference slot (including any state changes made in that slot), and must be processed before the frame's processing deadline.

Reference slot for each frame is set to the last slot of the epoch preceding the frame's first epoch. The processing deadline is set to the last slot of the last epoch of the frame.

It's worth noting that frame length [can be changed](/contracts/hash-consensus#setframeconfig). And if oracle report is delayed it does not extend the report period, unless it's missed. In this case, the next report will have the report period increased.

The frame includes these stages:

- **Waiting** - oracle starts as a [daemon](/guides/oracle-operator-manual#the-oracle-daemon) and wakes up every 12 seconds (by default) in order to find the last finalized slot, trying to collate it with the expected reference slot;
- **Data collection**: oracles monitor the state of both the execution and consensus layers and collect the data for the successfully arrived finalized reference slot;
- **Hash consensus**: oracles analyze the report data, compile the report and submit its hash to the [HashConsensus](/contracts/hash-consensus) smart contract;
- **Core update report**: once the [quorum](/contracts/hash-consensus#getquorum) of hashes is reached, meaning more than half of the oracles submitted the same hash (i.e., 5 of 9 oracle committee members at the moment of writing), one of the oracles chosen in turn submits the actual report to the `ValidatorsExitBusOracle` contract, which triggers a chain of the [`ValidatorExitRequest`](#validatorexitrequest) events containing details about the next validators to be ejected (to initiate a voluntary exit from the Ethereum Consensus Layer side).

## Report data

The function `submitReportData()` accepts the following `ReportData` structure.

```solidity
struct ReportData {
    uint256 consensusVersion;
    uint256 refSlot;
    uint256 requestsCount;
    uint256 dataFormat;
    bytes data;
}
```

**Oracle consensus info**

- `consensusVersion` — Version of the oracle consensus rules. A current version expected by the oracle can be obtained by calling `getConsensusVersion()`.
- `refSlot` — Reference slot for which the report was calculated. The state being reported must include all state changes resulting from the all blocks up to this reference slot (inclusive). The epoch containing the slot must be finalized prior to calculating the report.

**Requests data**

- `requestsCount` — Total number of validator exit requests in this report. Must not be greater
         than the limit enforced by `OracleReportSanityChecker.checkExitBusOracleReport`.
- `dataFormat` — Format of the validator exit requests data. Currently, only the `DATA_FORMAT_LIST=1` value is supported.
- `data` — Validator exit requests data. Can differ based on the data format, see the constant defining a specific data format [here](#data_format_list) for more info.

## Constants

### DATA_FORMAT_LIST()

The list format of the validator exit requests data.

:::note
Each validator exit request is described by the following 64-byte array:

```
    MSB <------------------------------------------------------- LSB
    |  3 bytes   |  5 bytes   |     8 bytes      |    48 bytes     |
    |  moduleId  |  nodeOpId  |  validatorIndex  | validatorPubkey |
```

 All requests are tightly packed into a byte array where requests follow
 one another without any separator or padding, and passed to the `data`
 field of the report structure.

Requests must be sorted in the ascending order by the following compound
key: `(moduleId, nodeOpId, validatorIndex)`.
:::

```solidity
uint256 public constant DATA_FORMAT_LIST = 1
```

### SECONDS_PER_SLOT()

See [https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/blocks/#block-time](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/blocks/#block-time)

:::note
always returns 12 seconds due to [the Merge](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/merge/)
:::

```solidity
uint256 public immutable SECONDS_PER_SLOT
```

### GENESIS_TIME()

See [https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/11/27/eth2-quick-update-no-21](https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/11/27/eth2-quick-update-no-21)

:::note
always returns 1606824023 (December 1, 2020, 12:00:23pm UTC) on [Mainnet](https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/11/27/eth2-quick-update-no-21)
:::

```solidity
uint256 public immutable GENESIS_TIME
```

### PAUSE_INFINITELY()

Special value for the infinite pause.
See [`pauseFor`](#pausefor) and [`pauseUntil`](#pauseuntil).

```solidity
uint256 public constant PAUSE_INFINITELY = type(uint256).max
```

## ProcessingState

```solidity
struct ProcessingState {
    uint256 currentFrameRefSlot;
    uint256 processingDeadlineTime;
    bytes32 dataHash;
    bool dataSubmitted;
    uint256 dataFormat;
    uint256 requestsCount;
    uint256 requestsSubmitted;
}
```

- `currentFrameRefSlot` — Reference slot for the current reporting frame.
- `processingDeadlineTime` — The last time at which a report data can be submitted for the current reporting frame.
- `dataHash` — Hash of the report data. Zero bytes if consensus on the hash hasn't been reached yet for the current reporting frame.
- `dataSubmitted` — Whether any report data for the current reporting frame has been already submitted.
- `dataFormat` — Format of the report data for the current reporting frame.
- `requestsCount` — Total number of validator exit requests for the current reporting frame.

`nodeOpIds` in the given `moduleId`. For node operators that were never requested to exit
any validator, index is set to `-1`.

```solidity
function getLastRequestedValidatorIndices(uint256 moduleId, uint256[] calldata nodeOpIds)
        external view returns (int256[] memory)
```
