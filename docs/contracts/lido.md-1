- [Deployed contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84)

Liquid staking pool and a related [ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20)
rebasing token (`stETH`)

## What is Lido?

Lido is a liquid staking pool and the core contract that is responsible for:

- accepting users' stake, buffering it and minting respective amounts of liquid token
- do a proper accounting based on received oracle reports and the current state of the protocol
- collecting withdrawals, priority fees and MEV from respective vaults into the buffer
- applying fees and distributing rewards
- passing buffered ether further to [StakingRouter](/contracts/staking-router) or [WithdrawalQueueERC721](/contracts/withdrawal-queue-erc721)

Also, Lido is an [ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) rebasing token,
which represents staked ether, `stETH`. Tokens are minted upon ether submission and
burned when redeemed. `stETH` holder balances are updated daily with oracle
reports.
It also implements the [ERC-2612](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612)
permit and [ERC-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271) signature
validation extensions.

Other contracts are bound to the core and have the following responsibilities:

- [`LidoLocator`](/contracts/lido-locator.md): protocol-wide address book which contains
references to all meaningful parts of the Lido protocol on-chain
- [`WithdrawalQueueERC721`](/contracts/withdrawal-queue-erc721.md): a withdrawal requests
FIFO queue and a respective NFT (unstETH)
- [`StakingRouter`](/contracts/staking-router.md): hub, which manages staking modules and
distributes the stake among them
- [`NodeOperatorsRegistry`](/contracts/node-operators-registry.md): original module,
responsible for managing the curated set of node operators
- [`OracleReportSanityChecker`](/contracts/oracle-report-sanity-checker.md): helper for
validation of oracle report parameters and smoothening token rebases
- [`Burner`](/contracts/burner.md): vault to contain `stETH` that ought to be burned on
oracle report
- [`WithdrawalVault`](/contracts/withdrawal-vault.md): vault to collect partial and full
withdrawals coming from the Beacon Chain
- [`LidoExecutionLayerRewardsVault`](/contracts/lido-execution-layer-rewards-vault.md):
vault to collect priority fees and MEV rewards coming from validators of the pool
- [`DepositSecurityModule`](/contracts/deposit-security-module.md): protection from
deposit frontrunning vulnerability
- [`AccountingOracle`](/contracts/accounting-oracle.md): oracle committee, which gathers
an accounting report for the protocol
- [`EIP712StETH`](/contracts/eip712-steth.md): ad-hoc helper to implement ERC-2612 permit
for Solidity 0.4.24 Lido contract

## Submit

Lido contract is a main entry point for stakers. To take part in the pool, a
user can send some ETH to the contract address and the same amount of `stETH`
tokens will be minted to the sender address. Submitted ether is accumulated in
the buffer and can be passed further to
[`WithdrawalQueueERC721`](/contracts/withdrawal-queue-erc721.md) to fulfill withdrawal
requests or to [`StakingRouter`](/contracts/staking-router.md) to deposit as a new
validator stake.

To withdraw the underlying ETH back, a user may use the [`WithdrawalQueueERC721`](/contracts/withdrawal-queue-erc721.md) contract or swap the token on the secondary market (it may be a cheaper and faster alternative).

## Deposit

User-submitted ether is stored in the buffer and can be later used for
withdrawals or passed further to [`StakingRouter`](/contracts/staking-router.md) to be
used as validator's deposits. It happens asynchronously and uses
[`DepositSecurityModule`](/contracts/deposit-security-module.md) as a guard to prevent
deposit frontrunning vulnerability.

```

## Redeem

The token might be redeemed for ether through the protocol using
the [`WithdrawalQueueERC721`](/contracts/withdrawal-queue-erc721.md) contract leveraging [staking withdrawals](https://ethereum.org/en/staking/withdrawals/)
enabled with the Shanghai/Capella (aka "Shapella") Ethereum hardfork.

## Rebase

When an oracle report occurs, the supply of the token is increased or decreased
algorithmically, based on staking rewards (or slashing penalties) on the Beacon
Chain, execution layer rewards (starting from
[the Merge](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/) Ethereum upgrade) or
fulfilled withdrawal requests (starting from
[Lido V2](https://blog.lido.fi/introducing-lido-v2/)). A rebase happens when
oracle reports beacon stats.

The rebasing mechanism is implemented via the "shares" concept. Instead of
storing a map with account balances, Lido stores which share of the total pool
is owned by the account. The balance of an account is calculated as follows:

```js
balanceOf(account) = shares[account] * totalPooledEther / totalShares
```

- `shares` - map of user account shares. Every time a user deposits ether, it is
 converted to shares and added to the current user shares amount.
- `totalShares` - the sum of shares of all accounts in the `shares` map
- `totalPooledEther` - a sum of three types of ether owned by protocol:

  - buffered balance - ether stored on contract and hasn't been deposited or
  locked for withdrawals yet
  - transient balance - ether submitted to the official Deposit contract but not
   yet visible in the beacon state
  - beacon balance - the total amount of ether on validator accounts. This value
  is reported by oracles and makes the strongest impact on stETH total supply
  change

For example, assume that we have:

```js
totalShares = 5
totalPooledEther = 10 ETH
sharesOf(Alice) -> 1
sharesOf(Bob) -> 4
```

Therefore:

```js
balanceOf(Alice) -> 2 tokens which corresponds to 2 ETH
balanceOf(Bob) -> 8 tokens which corresponds to 8 ETH
```

On each rebase `totalPooledEther` normally increases, indicating that there were
some rewards earned by validators, that ought to be distributed, so the user
balance gets increased as well automatically, despite their shares remaining as
they were.

```js
totalPooledEther = 15 ETH
// user balance increased
balanceOf(Alice) -> 3 tokens which corresponds to 3 ETH now
balanceOf(Bob) -> 12 tokens which corresponds to 12 ETH now
// shares remain still
sharesOf(Alice) -> 1
sharesOf(Bob) -> 4
```

:::note

Since the balances of all token holders change when the amount of total pooled
ether changes, this token cannot fully implement the ERC-20 standard: it only
emits `Transfer` events upon explicit transfer between holders. In contrast,
when the total amount of pooled ether increases, no `Transfer` events are
generated: doing so would require emitting an event for each token holder and
thus running an unbounded loop.

:::

## Oracle report

One of the cornerstones of the Lido protocol is the oracle report, that usually
(but not guaranteed) once a day provides the protocol with the data that can't
be easily accessed on-chain, but is required for precise accounting. It includes
some Beacon chain stats as well as corresponding EL-side values that are valid
on the reporting block and the decision data required to fulfill pending
withdrawal requests.

- Beacon chain stats:
  - the total number of validators managed by the pool
  - the total balance of validators managed by the pool
- Historical EL values:
  - withdrawal vault balance
  - execution layer rewards vault balance
  - burner stETH shares balance
- Withdrawal-related data
  - requests in the queue to be finalized
  - share rate to be used for finalization

Oracle report is processed in 9 simple steps:

1. Memorize the pre-state that will be required for incremental updates of the
protocol balance
2. Validate the report data using [`OracleReportSanityChecker`](/contracts/oracle-report-sanity-checker.md)
3. Calculate the amount of ether to be locked on [`WithdrawalQueueERC721`](/contracts/withdrawal-queue-erc721.md)
and move the respective amount of shares to be burnt to [`Burner`](/contracts/burner.md)
4. Using [`OracleReportSanityChecker`](/contracts/oracle-report-sanity-checker.md)
calculate the amounts of ether that can be withdrawn from
[`LidoExecutionLayerRewardsVault`](/contracts/lido-execution-layer-rewards-vault.md) and
[`WithdrawalVault`](/contracts/withdrawal-vault.md) as well as the number of shares that
can be burnt from [`Burner`](/contracts/burner.md) to avoid the rebase that can be easily
frontrun.
5. Collect the calculated amounts of ether from vaults and proceed with
withdrawal requests finalization: send requested ether to [`WithdrawalQueue`](/contracts/withdrawal-queue-erc721.md)
6. Burn the previously requested shares from [`Burner`](/contracts/burner.md) for
withdrawals or coverage application
7. Distribute rewards and protocol fees minting new stETH for the respective
parties
8. Complete token rebase by informing observers (emit an event and call the
external receivers if any)
9. Post-report sanity check for share rate provided with the report

```mermaid
graph LR;
  S[/Users' stake/]:::orange-.->B[Lido Buffer];
  W[WithdrawalsVault]-->B;
  E[LidoExecutionLayerRewardsVault]-->B;
  B-->D[StakingRouter];
  B-->WQ[WithdrawalQueue];
  classDef orange fill:#f96;

```

So, the observable outcome of the report for the protocol is the following:

- withdrawal requests in the queue are fulfilled
- ether is collected from withdrawal and EL rewards vaults to the buffer
- CL balance is updated according to the report
- rewards are distributed among stakers, staking modules and protocol treasury

:::

### transferFrom()

Moves `_amount` tokens from `_sender` to `_recipient` using the
allowance mechanism. `_amount` is then deducted from the caller's
allowance.

```sol
function transferFrom(
    address _sender,
    address _recipient,
    uint256 _amount
) returns (bool)
```
