# Verifier

- [Source code](https://github.com/lidofinance/staking-modules/blob/v3.0/src/Verifier.sol)
- [Deployed contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfce7aB839e55de77730716D05b3553e45ab3A5Ba)

`Verifier.sol` is a supplementary contract responsible for validating Consensus Layer (CL) data proofs against the beacon block root obtained via [EIP-4788](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4788) and reporting the verified facts to the module. All of its proof-processing methods are permissionless - anyone (typically the prover bot or the Node Operator) can submit a valid proof.

The following proof types are supported:

- validator withdrawal (including historical);
- validator balance (including historical);
- validator slashing.

## Hard-fork compatibility

`Verifier` does not inspect the Consensus Layer fork version directly. Instead, it supports two sets of [SSZ generalized indices](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/master/ssz/merkle-proofs.md#generalized-merkle-tree-index), separated by `PIVOT_SLOT`. Proofs for state slots before the pivot use one set of indices, while proofs for the pivot slot and later use the other.

`FIRST_SUPPORTED_SLOT` is the deployment's lower acceptance boundary and should not be advanced merely because a new fork occurs. If a fork changes any relevant proof path, the immutable constructor values cannot be updated. A replacement `Verifier` must be deployed, tested with proofs from both sides of the fork boundary, and authorized on the module before activation. A changed leaf schema may also require contract code changes rather than new gindices alone.

The Mainnet deployment sets both `FIRST_SUPPORTED_SLOT` and `PIVOT_SLOT` to the Electra activation slot and configures both sets of indices for the Electra layout. As a result, the deployment supports Electra and remains compatible with later hard forks while the relevant SSZ indices remain unchanged. A hard fork does not necessarily change these paths; nevertheless, the generalized indices must be revalidated against the finalized specification for each fork.

The following values and assumptions must be tracked:

| Value | Fork-sensitive assumptions to verify |
| --- | --- |
| `PIVOT_SLOT` | Activation slot at which the second set of proof paths becomes valid. |
| `GI_*` | SSZ generalized indices for the corresponding fields used in proofs. |
| `SLOTS_PER_EPOCH` | Epoch calculation used when checking validator withdrawability. |
| `BEACON_ROOTS` | EIP-4788 system-contract address and lookup semantics. |
| SSZ leaf schemas | Layouts of `BeaconBlockHeader`, `Validator`, and `Withdrawal`, whose roots are computed by the contract. |

## Upgradability

The contract is immutable.

    GIndices memory gindices,
    Slot firstSupportedSlot,

```

### processSlashedProof

```solidity
function processSlashedProof(ProcessSlashedInput calldata data) external whenResumed;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`data`|`ProcessSlashedInput`|@see ProcessSlashedInput|


### processWithdrawalProof

Verify withdrawal proof and report withdrawal to the module for valid proofs


```solidity
function processWithdrawalProof(ProcessWithdrawalInput calldata data) external whenResumed;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`data`|`ProcessWithdrawalInput`|@see ProcessWithdrawalInput|


### processHistoricalWithdrawalProof

Verify withdrawal proof against historical summaries data and report withdrawal to the module for valid proofs


```solidity
function processHistoricalWithdrawalProof(ProcessHistoricalWithdrawalInput calldata data) external whenResumed;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`data`|`ProcessHistoricalWithdrawalInput`|@see ProcessHistoricalWithdrawalInput|


### processBalanceProof

Verify a validator's balance proof from a recent beacon block and sync the key added balance.


```solidity
function processBalanceProof(ProcessBalanceProofInput calldata data) external whenResumed;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`data`|`ProcessBalanceProofInput`|The balance proof input containing recent block header, validator witness, and balance witness.|


### processHistoricalBalanceProof

Verify a validator's balance proof from a historical beacon block and sync the key added balance.
A historical proof is needed because the validator's balance may have increased at some point in the past
and later decreased (e.g. due to inactivity leak or penalties). A recent proof alone would miss that peak,
so a historical proof allows capturing the highest observed balance.


```solidity
function processHistoricalBalanceProof(ProcessHistoricalBalanceProofInput calldata data) external whenResumed;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`data`|`ProcessHistoricalBalanceProofInput`|The balance proof input containing recent + historical block headers, validator witness, and balance witness.|
