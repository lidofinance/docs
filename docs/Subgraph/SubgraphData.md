# Lido Subgraph Introduction

Lido has a GraphQL API Endpoint hosted by [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/docs/about/introduction#what-the-graph-is) called a subgraph for indexing and organizing data from the Sablier smart contracts.

This subgraph is can be used to query Lido data.

## GraphQL Schema

The schema of GraphQL elements available is defined in [`/schema.graphql` ](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-subgraph/blob/master/schema.graphql)

Subgraph information is serviced by a decentralized group of server operators called Indexers.
