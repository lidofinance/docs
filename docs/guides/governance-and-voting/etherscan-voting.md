# Guide to Delegation

This guide will walk you through how to vote, override your delegate's vote, and delegate your voting power using Etherscan. If the [Voting UI](https://vote.lido.fi/) is unavailable or you prefer to vote via Etherscan, follow these simple steps.

## Getting Started

Obtain the address of the Lido DAO `Aragon Voting` contract from the [Deployed Contracts](/deployed-contracts/#dao-contracts) page. Currently, it is [`0x2e59A20f205bB85a89C53f1936454680651E618e`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2e59A20f205bB85a89C53f1936454680651E618e). Open this contract on Etherscan.

## Voting

### Step 1: Find the Voting ID
- Go to the **Contract** tab.

- Go to the **Read as Proxy** tab of the Aragon Voting contract.
- Locate the `votesLength` method (number 29) to get the current vote ID.

The number you see here is the ID of the current vote. For example, if it shows 110, that's the current vote ID.

### Step 2: Review the Proposal

- Use the `getVote` method (number 9) to review the proposal. Note that to understand the proposed changes, you will need to decode the bytecode into readable scripts.

### Step 3: Cast Your Vote

- Navigate to the **Write as Proxy** tab.
- Click **Connect to Web3** and connect the address where you hold LDO tokens. The indicator should turn green.

- Use the `vote` method (number 13).

- Fill in the parameters `_voteId`, `_supports`, and `_executesIfDecided` and send the transaction:
    - `_voteId` is the vote ID from Step 1.
    - `_supports` indicates whether you support (`true`) or oppose (`false`) the vote.
    - `_executesIfDecided` should be set to `false`.

### Step 4: Sign the Transaction

Sign the transaction to cast your vote. That's it! ðŸŽ‰

## Overriding

### Step 1: Check Delegate's Vote
-  Go to the **Contract** tab.

- Go to the **Read as Proxy** tab of the Aragon Voting contract.
- Use the `getVoterState` method (number 7).

Enter the vote ID and your address to see how your delegate voted. 

### Step 2: Vote Yourself

If you disagree with the delegate's choice and wish to vote yourself, follow the steps in the **Voting Steps** section.
