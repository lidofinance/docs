# Validators Exit Bus

:::info
It's advised to read [What is Lido Oracle mechanism](/guides/oracle-operator-manual#intro) before
:::

[Validators Exit Bus](/contracts/validators-exit-bus-oracle) is an oracle that ejects Lido validators when the protocol requires additional funds to process user withdrawals.

There are two stages of selecting validators for exit: Covering Demand in WQ and Boosted Exits

A report calculation consists of 6 key steps:

1. Calculate withdrawals amount to cover with ether.
2. Calculate ether rewards prediction per epoch.
3. Calculate withdrawal epoch for next validator eligible for exit to cover withdrawal requests if needed.
4. Prepare validators exit order queue to fulfill withdrawals.
5. Extend exit list with forced to exit validators (`targetLimitMode` is set to the boosted mode) up to the report limit or until there are no forced requests.
6. Go through the queue until the exited validatorsâ€™ balances cover all withdrawal requests (considering the predicated final exited balance of each validator).

:::note
Placed exit requests via `ValidatorsExitBusOracle` should be processed timely according to the ratified Lido on Ethereum Validator Exits SNOP 3.0 ([IPFS](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmW9kE61zC61PcuikCQRwn82aoTCj9yPuENGNPML9QLkSM), [GitHub](https://github.com/lidofinance/documents-and-policies/blob/main/Lido%20on%20Ethereum%20Standard%20Node%20Operator%20Protocol%20-%20Validator%20Exits.md)).

## Next validator to exit algorithm

The algorithm for the validators exiting is based on [the algorithm described on the research forum](https://research.lido.fi/t/withdrawals-on-validator-exiting-order/3048#combined-approach-17).

The algorithm is supposed to correct the future number of validators for each Node Operator. Suppose the validators and deposits in-flight of one of the Node Operator are represented in the following form, where validators are sorted by their indexes:

![VEBO 1](../../../static/img/oracle-spec/vebo-1.png)

The algorithm assumes that the oldest validators are exited first. Therefore, previously requested validators can be separated to exit by knowing the index of the last requested.

![VEBO 2](../../../static/img/oracle-spec/vebo-2.png)

Worth noting, each validator has a status. Some validators may be slashed or be exited without an request from the protocol:

![VEBO 3](../../../static/img/oracle-spec/vebo-3.png)

Among all validators the projected ones are the point of interest. They include all active validators and in-flight deposits, but exclude validators whose `exit_epoch != FAR_FUTURE_EPOCH` and those validators that were requested to exit.

![VEBO 4](../../../static/img/oracle-spec/vebo-4.png)

A few hours later it might look like the following:
![VEBO 5](../../../static/img/oracle-spec/vebo-5.png)

Note that the described algorithm is looking for a validator to exit only among those that can be exited, while using the projected number of validators, which includes non-existent yet validators. It's only weights, so there is no misconception here.

The final exit order predicate sequence to fulfill withdrawal requests:

1. Validator whose operator with the lowest number of delayed validators
2. Validator whose operator with the highest number of boosted targeted validators to exit
3. Validator whose operator with the highest number of soft targeted validators to exit
4. Validator whose staking module with the highest deviation from the exit share limit
5. Validator whose operator with the highest stake weight
6. Validator whose operator with the highest number of validators
7. Validator with the lowest index

Exit order for node operators with active forced target limits:

1. Validator whose operator with the highest number of forced targeted validators to exit
2. Validator with the lowest index

## Get information to prepare ordered queue

In order to prepare a queue of validators to exit, the following actions and considerations involved:

- the maximum number of validators that can be requested to exit in one report;
- operator network penetration percent - only if the operator's share is greater than 1%;
- 'exitable' Lido validators;
- fetch node operators stats;
- total predictable validators count;
- last requested validators indices;

### Report limits

- `maxValidatorExitRequestsPerReport` - max number of exit requests allowed in report to `ValidatorsExitBusOracle` from `OracleReportSanityChecker.getOracleReportLimits()`.
- `VALIDATOR_DELAYED_TIMEOUT_IN_SLOTS` - A parameter from `OracleDaemonConfig` contract used to calculate validators going to exit.
- `NODE_OPERATOR_NETWORK_PENETRATION_THRESHOLD_BP` - - A parameter from `OracleDaemonConfig` that is taken into account when determining the penetration of the operator into the network.

### Get exitable validators

A validator is 'exitable' if two conditions are strictly have NOT met:

- `validator.exit_epoch != FAR_FUTURE_EPOCH` and
- `validator.index <= last_requested_to_exit_index`.

### Node operator stats

Statistics for each node operator, which are needed for sorting their validators in exit order:

- validators count that are not yet in CL
- validators that are in CL and are not yet requested to exit and not on exit
- validators that are in CL and requested to exit but not on exit and not requested to exit recently 
- target type (soft/boosted) and target validators count
- checks whether the target limit mode is set

NB: A validator can not be considered as delayed if it was requested to exit in last `VALIDATOR_DELAYED_TIMEOUT_IN_SLOTS` slots

#### Last requested validators indices

The [`ValidatorsExitBusOracle`](/contracts/validators-exit-bus-oracle.md) contract stores the index of the last validator that was requested to exit. Since validators are requested in strict order from the lowest `validatorIndex` to the highest, the indexes help find all the previously requested validators without fetching all events.

Returns the latest validator indices that were requested to exit for the given
        `operator_indexes` in the given `module`. For node operators that were never requested to exit
        any validator yet, index is set to `-1`.

```
ValidatorsExitBusOracle.getLastRequestedValidatorIndices(
    uint256 moduleId,
    uint256[] nodeOpIds
): int256[]
```

### State collection

To find the next validators to exit, Validators Exit Bus Oracle collects the following state from both Ethereum Consensus and Execution layers.

- From [OracleDaemonConfig](/contracts/oracle-daemon-config) contract:
  - PREDICTION_DURATION_IN_SLOTS
  - VALIDATOR_DELAYED_TIMEOUT_IN_SLOTS
- From [Withdrawal Queue](/contracts/withdrawal-queue-erc721):
  - Get total unfinalized withdrawal request amount
- From [Lido](/contracts/lido) contract:
  - Recent postCLBalance/preCLBalance and withdrawals from Execution Layer Rewards and Withdrawal vaults via events
- From Consensus Layer node:
  - All validators and their states on the reference slot
- From [Staking Router](/contracts/staking-router):
  - Public keys of all Lido validators
  - Indices of the last requested validator to exit for each Node Operator
  - Validator keys statistics for each Node Operator
- From Oracle contract:
  - Maximum number of exit requests for the current frame
  - Recently requested via Exit Bus public keys to exit

### Fetching data

#### Get uncovered withdrawal requests amount of stETH

Collects the amount of stETH in the queue yet to be finalized from `WithdrawalQueue.unfinalizedStETH()`

#### Calculate average rewards speed per epoch

Fetches `ETHDistributed` and `TokenRebased` events from the [`Lido`](/contracts/lido) contract and calculate average rewards amount per epoch. The rewards prediction period config fetches from the [OracleDaemonConfig](/contracts/oracle-daemon-config) contract.

To get events in past, addressing the cases where there can be slots with missed block, the next scheme is introduced:

![VEBO 6](../../../static/img/oracle-spec/vebo-6.png)

- Get from [OracleDaemonConfig](/contracts/oracle-daemon-config) contract `PREDICTION_DURATION_IN_SLOTS` value
- Get `TokenRebased` events from Lido
- Get `ETHDistributed` events from Lido
- Group that events by transaction hash
- Collect from events:
  - `total_rewards` as `postCLBalance + withdrawalsWithdrawn - preCLBalance executionLayerRewardsWithdrawn`
  - `time_spent` as sum of each event `timeElapsed`
- calculate `rewards_speed_per_epoch` as `max(total_rewards * chain_configs.seconds_per_slot * chain_configs.slots_per_epoch // time_spent, 0)`

#### Calculate epochs to sweep

##### Average sweep prediction

Predicts the average epochs of the sweep cycle. In the spec: [get expected withdrawals](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/electra/beacon-chain.md#modified-get_expected_withdrawals), [process withdrawals](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/electra/beacon-chain.md#modified-process_withdrawals)

[source](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-oracle/blob/master/src/modules/ejector/sweep.py#L40)

##### Withdrawable validators

- Check if `validator` has the eth1 withdrawal credentials prefixed with 0x01 *OR* 'compound' withdrawal credentials' prefixed with 0x02, *and*
- Check if `validator` is partially withdrawable, *or*
- Check if `validator` is fully withdrawable

[source](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-oracle/blob/master/src/modules/ejector/ejector.py#L342)

#### Predict available ether before next withdrawn

In order to estimate the amount is needed to fully cover the non-finalized withdraw requests, the following values are calculated

- **Future rewards**
- **Future withdrawals amount**
- **Total available balance**
- **Validators to eject cumulative amount**
- **Going to withdrawn balance**

To calculate **future rewards**, it's needed to [predict](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-oracle/blob/master/src/modules/ejector/ejector.py#L244) an epoch when all validators in queue and `validators_to_eject` will be withdrawn:

1. Calculate latest exit epoch number and amount of validators that are exiting in this epoch
2. If queue is empty - exit epoch will be calculated as `current epoch + MAX_SEED_LOOK AHEAD + 1`. **MAX_SEED_LOOKAHEAD** constant needs to mitigate some attacks, more details [here](https://eth2book.info/bellatrix/part3/config/preset/#max_seed_lookahead)
3. Calculate **churn limit** - like a rate-limit on a balance change in the validator set. Minimum rate is 128 ETH per epoch. The churn limit changes in increments of `EFFECTIVE_BALANCE_INCREMENT = 1 eth`. [spec](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/electra/beacon-chain.md#new-get_balance_churn_limit)
4. Calculate slots capacity for exit:

```!
remain_exits_capacity_for_epoch=churn_limit - (amount of validators that are exiting in this epoch)
```

5. Calculate epoch to exit all `validators_to_eject_count`:

```!
epochs_required_to_exit_validators = (validators_to_eject_count - remain_exits_capacity_for_epoch) // churn_limit + 1
```

6. So the predictable withdrawable epoch:

```!
withdrawal_epoch=max_exit_epoch_number + epochs_required_to_exit_validators + MIN_VALIDATOR_WITHDRAWABILITY_DELAY)
```

MIN_VALIDATOR_WITHDRAWABILITY_DELAY [here](https://eth2book.info/altair/part3/config/configuration#min_validator_withdrawability_delay)

So now we can calculate what amount (and validators count) is needed to fully cover amount of non-finalized WithdrawQueue requests.

#### Calculate expected balance to withdraw

##### Future rewards

```!
future_rewards = (withdrawal_epoch + epochs_to_sweep - blockstamp.ref_epoch ) * rewards_speed_per_epoch
```

##### Future withdrawals amount

Get total balance from validators which can be fully withdrawn.

##### Total available balance

Fetch total balance as sum from:

- `Lido.getBufferedEther()` +
- Balance from `elRewardsVault` +
- Balance from `withdrawalVault`

##### Validators to eject cumulative amount

Get balance from next validator in exit queue.

##### Validators going to exit

Fetches recently emitted `ValidatorExitRequest` events from `ValidatorsExitBusOracle` contract and extract pubkeys from them. The delayed timeout config fetches from the `OracleDaemonConfig` contract.

Validators requested to exit, but didn't send exit message.
In case:

- Activation epoch is not old enough to initiate exit
- Node operator had not enough time to send exit message (VALIDATOR_DELAYED_TIMEOUT_IN_SLOTS)

To get validators, oracle calculates:

- `lido_validators_by_operator` - Fetches all used Lido keys from [Keys API](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-keys-api) + Fetches all validators at the reference slot and merge them with keys
- `ejected_indexes` - get operators with last exited validator indexes from for all staking_modules and node operators via `ValidatorsExitBusOracle.getLastRequestedValidatorIndices(module_id, uint256[] nodeOpIds)`
- `recent_pubkeys` - get last requested to exit pubkeys from `ValidatorExitRequest` event

For each `lido_validators_by_operator` oracle tries to find **non exited validators**, so:

- if not `validator_asked_to_exit` -> return False
- if `is_on_exit` -> return false
- if `validator_recently_asked_to_exit` -> return **True**
- if not `validator_eligible_to_exit` -> return **True**
- otherwise return False

Oracle calculates `going_to_withdraw_balance` for all **non exited validators**

##### Compare expected_balance vs to_withdrawn_balance

Expected balance is:

```
expected_balance = (
  future_withdrawals +  # Validators that have withdrawal_epoch
  future_rewards +  # Rewards we get until last validator in validators_to_eject will be withdrawn
  total_available_balance +  # Current EL balance (el vault, wc vault, buffered eth)
  validator_to_eject_balance_sum +  # Validators that we expected to be ejected (requested to exit, not delayed)
  going_to_withdraw_balance  # validators_to_eject balance
)
```

First of all, it's checked without exiting the validator, whether the protocol already has enough available ether to cover withdrawal requests in the queue. If yes, then it's not reasonable to exit validators.

If there is not enough, one more validator is considered to be exited and the expected balance gets calculated again. The process continues until the expected balance becomes greater than or equal to the unfinalized withdrawal requests amount.

#### Boosted Exits

This stage presupposes the exit of validators requiring exit regardless of the demand in WQ. The state of operators and validators after the first step is filtered, leaving only validators of operators having `targetLimitMode` set to boosted exits.

Let's consider the target limit modes in more detail:

- `0` - **Disabled.** This mode implies no limitation. The operator is not restricted in receiving new stakes and does not have additional priorities when choosing validators for exit.

- `1` - **Smooth exit mode.** The operator has a limit on the number of active validators. As long as the number of active validators of the operator does not exceed the `targetLimit`, the operator receives stakes under general conditions. If this value is reached, the operator stops receiving new stakes (should be implemented at the module level). If the number of active keys of the operator exceeds the `targetLimit`, then such an operator's validators are prioritized for exit in the amount of targeted validators to exit.

- `2` - **Boosted exit mode.** Similar to smooth mode, but does not consider demand in WQ. The operator's validators in the amount of targeted validators to exit are prioritized for exit and requested without considering demand in WQ.
