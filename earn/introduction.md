# Introduction

## Lido Earn ETH

Lido Earn ETH is Meta Vault, an aggregation layer where deposited ETH based assets are distributed across multiple managed strategies for optimized returns and best in class user experience.

### How it works

Deposited tokens are allocated across yield-generating protocols through subVaults, with returns automatically compounded into the earnUSD share token, reflecting each depositor's share and performance. Currently there're two subVaults, managed by Veda and Edge Capital respectively.

### How deposits work

Users can deposit ETH, wETH, wstETH, GG or strETH with up to a 24-hour depositing waiting period and receive the share token earnETH.

### How withdrawals work

Users can withdraw wsETH in two steps (request + claim) with a typical withdrawals waiting time ~3 days.
