# Introduction

## EarnETH

EarnETH provides on-chain access to strategies involving ETH-denominated digital assets. It uses defined asset selection and risk controls, supported by transparent reporting.

### How it works

Deposited tokens are allocated across yield-generating protocols through subVaults, with returns automatically compounded into the earnUSD share token, reflecting each depositor's share and performance. Currently there're two subVaults, managed by Veda and UltraYield by Edge respectively.

### How deposits work

Users can deposit ETH, wETH, wstETH, GG or strETH with up to a 24-hour depositing waiting period and receive the share token earnETH.

### How withdrawals work

Users can withdraw wsETH in two steps (request + claim) with a typical withdrawals waiting time ~3 days.
