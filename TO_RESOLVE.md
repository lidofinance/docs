# To Resolve

- Confirm the authoritative list of stVaults Easy Track factory addresses (not present in `deployed-mainnet.json` or `configs/config_mainnet.py`). Should they be documented in `docs/guides/protocol-levers.md`?
- Confirm which Lido Aragon ACL permissions control protocol fee and treasury updates in V3 (current Lido roles are unassigned in `test_permissions.py`).
- Clarify which section in `docs/contracts/vault-hub.md` was flagged as “Outdated” in review; no specific line content was provided.
